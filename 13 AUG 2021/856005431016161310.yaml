  S: Hello there, how may I help you?
  V: I was told to contact you
    Something about I was falsely accused of scamming
  S: Could you please give me the full details about this report like a screenshot of the conversation between that user
  V: Sure, one sec ("fake screenshot of message from Steam Support" from 875684222310948864.yaml)
    I'm sure this will be easily cleared up since I haven't done anything
    Do you need my steam account?
  S: Screenshot of the conversation between that user
  V: Oh, I see. One second. (Screenshot of conversation with 875684222310948864.yaml)
    So what did this guy lose supposedly, if you don't mind me asking?
  S: Alright, Please give me your steam Profile link so I can take a quick review of your account
  V: Do you not have that already?
  S: Please give me your steam Profile link so I can take a quick review of your account

  S: (fake screenshot of "Report Violation" from "Valve Report Assistance Team" for "Fraud transaction")
    (fake screenshot of Steam profile page with various bits of information like "Pending Ban", "Active Ban Report", the Valve logo and "Valve Report Assistance.")
  Do you understand that you have a pending ban concerning multiple scam reports and accused of illegal purchases, which may lead to account deletion if not proven innocent
  V: Is that what Steam moderation tools look like?
    I understand, but I know I didn't do anything wrong.
  S: So would you like to make an appeal to clear these reports?
  V: Uh, yeah. That's why I messaged you.
  S: First go to https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/ and make a full window screenshot there and send it here. Just take a screenshot and don't scroll down
  V: You're a Steam administrator. You already have access to that information.
    Why do I need to send a screenshot?
  S: First go to https://store.steampowered.com/account/history/ and make a full window screenshot there and send it here. Just take a screenshot and don't scroll down
    Read the instructions if you want to fix your account
  V: Why are you deleting messages?
    I read your instructions, but you're not answering my questions
    What is your name? I want to check the moderator list.
  S: Have a nice day
  V: no, I'm not finished here
    Answer the questions
    Why are you scamming people?
  S: XD
  V: Do you really make that much money to justify wasting this much time?
    You do realize I have MessageLogger on, right? (Screenshot of part of current conversation)
    What's stopping me from reporting you to Discord and Steam right now?
